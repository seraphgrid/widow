widow is a modal desktop environment based on dwm, meaning that using the interface is broken down
into various states. right now there's just two: a vim-like state and an insert mode which lets
you interact with applications.

[Incoming/Planned]

* Auto-installation script that covers every base regarding the building and installation of applications I find quintessential to a "suckless experience". This should ease stress when hacking widow.
* Incorporation of dwmblocks for further enhancements where necessary.
* Linux security modules for dwmbar. Mysterious! Owo
* A minimal but pretty looking s.lock configuration.
