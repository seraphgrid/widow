* Adherence to suckless philosophy in both aesthetics and usage.*
* Plethora of patches provided via the usage of flexipatch for the initial stages of development.
* Modification of dmenu to allow running applications in the terminal or launching desktop files, that does not break or repatch dmenu.
* Minimal prettification of dunst. 
* Hand-crafted but minimal modifications made to various dwmbar modules.
  * For example, the mpd module truncates text after a certain length in a manner that keeps the top bar from feeling too crowded.  
* Systemwide Vim and Insert mode functionality for navigating or launching applications.


Incoming/Planned

* Auto-installation script that covers every base regarding the building and installation of applications I find quintessential to a "suckless experience". This should ease stress when hacking widow.
* Incorporation of dwmblocks for further enhancements where necessary.
* Linux security modules for dwmbar. Mysterious! Owo
* A minimal but pretty looking s.lock configuration.
